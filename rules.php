<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is an internet application created by me, Pantelis Pappas, as a university project.
<p>Due my love of Bullet Hell games and programming I thought it would be a good idea to combine two thing I really love, while learning and creating something usefull(I think).
<br><br><br>
<h2>Rules and submitions</h2>
<p>DO NOT CHEAT!!! There is no merit in showcasing the run of a cheater.
<p>Be very careful when completing the forms of replay submition. It is a requirement that the data matches exactly this video replay being showcased. (Automating the prossess in still in progress.)
<p>Do not post other people's replays. Every replay should be associated with the users account.
